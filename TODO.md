Nice to have
- Would like to make a custom help formatter
(see default [formatter](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/blob/async/discord/ext/commands/formatter.py)
and "formatter" commands.Bot arg)
- Look into an exit more graceful than Interrupt
- [vlc.py](https://wiki.videolan.org/PythonBinding/) voice output (note: lib needs VLC_PLUGIN_PATH set to plugins/.. (eg. VLC.app/Contents/MacOS, which contains a plugins folder)) (clone their [repo](https://git.videolan.org/git/vlc/bindings/python.git) for full package/readme)
- Split into modules (eg. voice, management?, grouped commands?)
