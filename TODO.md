Soon
- Wrap bot into class (starting to need globals/better state)

Nice to have
- Would like to make a custom help formatter
(see default [formatter](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/blob/async/discord/ext/commands/formatter.py)
and "formatter" commands.Bot arg)
- Look into an exit more graceful than Interrupt
- Split into modules (eg. voice, management?, grouped commands?)
