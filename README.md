# CrabBot
Silly Discord bot for giggles and testing

Mostly prints funny messages in reply to ! commands (see on_message code for commands)

Requires [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) v0.10 (async beta)

Needs a user.cfg in PWD (for now) with Discord credentials in the format:

    username
    password
