# CrabBot
Silly Discord bot for giggles and testing

NOTE: I AM UNABLE TO TEST THE CURRENT CODE   produces a socket error, I'm probably just misconfiguring my app or something, but I'm too lazy right now

Mostly prints funny messages in reply to commands (see on_message code for commands and command_prefix for the prefix)

By default, use !crabhelp to see a list of visible commands

Requires [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) v0.10 (async beta)

Needs a user.cfg in PWD (for now) with a Discord bot login token
